# Advent of Code 2017 #
---

These are my solutions to [Advent of Code 2017](https://adventofcode.com/2017 "Advent of Code 2017"). The directory structure is fairly self-explanatory: each day's puzzle is contained within a top-level directory of the same name. Inside each of these are whatever files are required to complete the puzzle (i.e. each directory is self-contained). Puzzle input's are also provided in `input.txt` files.

At present, most solutions are in Python (this may or may not change).
